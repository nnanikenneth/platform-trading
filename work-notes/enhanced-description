Key Problem Areas Addressed:
Authorization of Buyers to View Deals:

The BuyerSeller model, along with the authorizedBuyers relation in the Seller model, ensures that buyers can only view the deals of sellers they are authorized to see.
The AuthorizationRequest model facilitates the process of buyers requesting access from sellers, and sellers approving or rejecting these requests.
The AuthorizationLevel enum allows for different levels of access (e.g., view-only vs. full access), enabling sellers to control what buyers can see and do.
Time-Based Access:

The BuyerSeller model now includes the authorizedUntil field, allowing for time-limited access to a seller's deals.
Sellers can specify accessDuration in the Seller model to automatically grant buyers temporary access that expires after a certain period. This covers the requirement for temporary access.
Public Access (Granting All Buyers Access):

The publicAccess field in the Seller model allows sellers to make all of their deals visible to all buyers without the need for explicit authorization. This means if a seller enables public access, all buyers can see the deals by default.
Webhook Notifications:

The WebhookDelivery model ensures that once a buyer is authorized to see a seller’s deals, they can receive notifications (via webhooks) about updates to those deals. This includes price changes, status changes (e.g., sold or available), or new deals being posted.
Practical Example:
Let’s go through a practical example based on the schema:

Connection to the Platform:

Buyers and sellers connect to the platform via REST API. Sellers post deals using endpoints secured with JWT authentication.
Buyers use similar endpoints to retrieve deals they are authorized to see, with JWT authentication to verify their identity.
Requesting Access:

If Buyer A tries to view deals from Seller B but isn't authorized, they will get a message indicating that access is restricted.
Buyer A can then send an authorization request (via an API endpoint) to Seller B, and Seller B can approve or reject the request.
If approved, Buyer A will be added to the BuyerSeller junction table with a corresponding authorizationLevel and (optionally) an authorizedUntil date.
Granting and Managing Access:

Sellers can log in to their dashboard and manage which buyers can see their deals. This includes granting access to individual buyers, setting custom access levels (view-only, full access), and revoking access when needed.
Sellers can also decide to make all their deals public using the publicAccess field, removing the need for individual authorizations.
Post-Authorization Notifications:

Once authorized, Buyer A will start receiving notifications via the webhook system whenever there’s a change in Seller B’s deals (e.g., price change or a new deal). The WebhookDelivery model tracks and manages these notifications, ensuring they are delivered and, if necessary, retried.
Custom Features:

Sellers can provide different levels of access to different buyers and even grant time-limited access based on the accessDuration field.
Buyers can also opt into time-based access, allowing for more flexible control over who can see what and for how long.
